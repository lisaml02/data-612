# Letâ€™s say we want compute the sum of w, x, y, and z for each row. We start by making a row-wise data frame: We then use mutate() to add a new column to each row, or. just use summarise() to return the summary:

rf <- df %>% rowwise(id)
# mutate to add new column for each row
rf %>% mutate(total = sum(c(w, x, y, z)))

# summarize without mutate
rf %>% summarise(total = sum(c(w, x, y, z)), .groups= "drop")

rf %>% mutate(total = sum(c_across(w:z))) # c_across() working with different columns simultaneously; If you have a lot of variables, you can use c_across() to succinctly select many variables (c_across() uses tidy select helpers) 

rf %>% mutate(total = sum(c_across(where(is.numeric)))) #  ensures we only select numeric columns; this line sums the different columns but numerical columns (where numeric columns = TRUE)
